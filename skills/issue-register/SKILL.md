description: Use when you have MULTIPLE raw ideas to sort out — a brain-dump, a notes file, or several half-formed ideas — that need to be clarified, clustered, and organized before any design, especially when it is unclear which ideas are independent, how they group, or which are worth pursuing. This skill is for MANY ideas; for a single idea, use brainstorming instead.

# Issue Register

Turn a messy pile of idea notes into a clustered, well-articulated **pre-spec issue map** — clarified and grilled relentlessly, borrowing brainstorming's front-half procedure, but stopping before any solution, approach, architecture, or spec.

It takes MANY raw notes (some independent, some related), clusters them into shippable groups, grills each to pre-spec, and writes a durable map with the links between groups and slices preserved.

<HARD-GATE>
**Precondition — MULTIPLE ideas only.** This skill exists to cluster and organize *many* ideas. If you are down to a single idea — even an underdeveloped or unclear one — STOP and redirect to `brainstorming`. One idea has nothing to cluster; do not run this skill on it, and do not "cluster-of-one" your way through it.
</HARD-GATE>

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT write a spec, write code, or publish implementation issues. Only clarify, cluster, and articulate to **pre-spec** — problem, intent, constraints, success criteria. Solution space begins the moment you say "we could build it as X" or "here are 2-3 approaches" — stop before that, for EVERY cluster, regardless of how obvious the solution seems. This applies to every idea regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "These Notes Are Clear Enough"

Every idea dump goes through clustering and clarification, even a short one. "Obvious" ideas are where unexamined assumptions — and hidden independence between ideas — cause the most wasted work downstream. The map can be short, but you MUST cluster, grill the fuzzy parts, and keep the links.

## When to Use

- A brain-dump, notes file, or several half-formed ideas.
- Unclear which ideas are independent, how they group, or which are worth pursuing.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each item and complete them in order:

1. **Ingest & atomize** — parse the notes into discrete atomic ideas. Lose none; merge none silently.
2. **Explore project context** — if a codebase exists, read it (files, docs, recent commits). A question the codebase can answer, answer by reading — don't ask it.
3. **Tentative clustering** — group the atomic ideas into candidate clusters, each an *independently-shippable* concern. Separate "these are independent groups" from "these are one group." Present the tentative map and get a reaction BEFORE deep grilling.
4. **Clarify & grill each cluster to pre-spec** — relentlessly, one question at a time (see below). Sharpen fuzzy terms. Re-cluster as understanding sharpens.
5. **Nested slicing (only if a cluster is truly big/complex)** — split into child work-items, each still pre-spec. PRESERVE THE LINK: stable IDs + explicit parent refs.
6. **Write the register** — produce the map artifact (template below). Map-first (markdown); export to a tracker only if asked.
7. **Stop & hand off** — present the reviewed map. Per work-item the next step is depth elsewhere (`brainstorming`). When handing one off, pass its **register path + stable ID** (and parent ID if a child) so the link survives the boundary — the downstream work traces back to its register entry. Do NOT cross the seam here.

## Process Flow

```dot
digraph issue_register {
    "Ingest & atomize notes" [shape=box];
    "Explore project context" [shape=box];
    "Tentative clustering" [shape=box];
    "Present map, get reaction" [shape=box];
    "Clarify & grill a cluster (pre-spec)" [shape=box];
    "Cluster truly big/complex?" [shape=diamond];
    "Nested-slice (keep links)" [shape=box];
    "More clusters to grill?" [shape=diamond];
    "Write register + hand off" [shape=doublecircle];

    "Ingest & atomize notes" -> "Explore project context";
    "Explore project context" -> "Tentative clustering";
    "Tentative clustering" -> "Present map, get reaction";
    "Present map, get reaction" -> "Clarify & grill a cluster (pre-spec)";
    "Clarify & grill a cluster (pre-spec)" -> "Cluster truly big/complex?";
    "Cluster truly big/complex?" -> "Nested-slice (keep links)" [label="yes"];
    "Cluster truly big/complex?" -> "More clusters to grill?" [label="no"];
    "Nested-slice (keep links)" -> "More clusters to grill?";
    "More clusters to grill?" -> "Clarify & grill a cluster (pre-spec)" [label="yes / re-cluster"];
    "More clusters to grill?" -> "Write register + hand off" [label="no"];
}
```

## Understanding the Idea

*Vendored verbatim from the `brainstorming` skill (front-half only) so this skill is self-contained. Applied per cluster, kept strictly pre-spec — stop before approaches/design.*

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? **In this skill that decomposition IS the clustering — each piece becomes a cluster/work-item in the register, not a spec. Do NOT continue into brainstorming's design flow here.**
- For appropriately-scoped clusters, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

## Grilling a Cluster (the relentless interview)

Interview relentlessly about every aspect of the cluster until you reach a shared understanding of the *problem* — never the solution. Walk down each branch of the idea, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

- Ask questions **one at a time**, waiting for feedback before continuing. Multiple questions at once is bewildering.
- If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore instead of asking.
- Sharpen fuzzy or overloaded terms into precise ones ("you say 'account' — Customer or User? Those are different things").
- **Triage the grilling:** grill what is fuzzy or important; don't grind already-clear or low-priority notes to death across a large dump.
- **Stay at pre-spec:** purpose, constraints, success criteria. The moment talk turns to *how to build it*, stop and record it as a downstream question — do not answer it here.

## The Register Artifact

A markdown file (`docs/issue-register/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`, or a project `REGISTER.md`). Groups → work-items → optional children.

Each work-item:

- **ID** — stable (`R1`, child `R1.2`)
- **Title**
- **Cluster / parent** — which group; parent ID if a child (this is the link)
- **Problem & intent** — what and why, from the user's perspective
- **Constraints** — non-negotiables, boundaries
- **Success criteria** — how you would know it is addressed (outcome, not implementation)
- **Open questions** — unresolved after grilling
- **Status** — `pre-spec` | `needs-more-grilling` | `parked`
- **Relations** — standalone, or `blocked-by` / `relates-to <IDs>`

Deliberately **NOT** in a work-item: solution, architecture, tech choices, file paths, acceptance-criteria-as-tasks. Those belong downstream.

## Clustering Rules

- A cluster is something that could be pursued or shipped **independently** of the others.
- Two notes share a cluster only if they share a *problem or outcome* — not merely a topic, technology, or vibe.
- Unsure whether two things are one cluster or two? Ask (one question). Over-merging hides independent shippables; over-splitting loses coherence.
- Every atomic note is traceable to exactly one work-item, or explicitly **parked**. Nothing silently dropped.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Running on a single idea (cluster-of-one) | Wrong skill — this needs multiple ideas. Redirect to `brainstorming`. |
| Crossing the seam (proposing solutions/approaches/architecture) | Stop at problem/constraints/success. Record "how" as a downstream question. |
| Turning it into a design/spec (brainstorming's telos leaking in) | This skill's terminal state is a pre-spec map, NOT a design. Hand off for design. |
| One-idea tunnel vision (treating the whole dump as a single project) | It is usually several. Cluster first. |
| Losing links when slicing (orphaned children) | Stable IDs + parent refs, always. |
| Dropping the link at handoff | Pass the register path + work-item ID (and parent ID) downstream so the graph survives the boundary. |
| Grilling everything to death | Triage: grill what is fuzzy or important. |
| Silent drops or merges (notes vanishing into vague clusters) | Every note → one work-item, or explicitly parked. |
| Publishing implementation issues | That happens downstream, after design. The register is pre-spec. |

## Key Principles

- **Many ideas, not one** — this skill clusters a plurality; a lone idea belongs in `brainstorming`.
- **Cluster first, then grill** — grilling needs a target; establish tentative groups before deep interviewing.
- **One question at a time** — with your recommended answer.
- **Keep the link** — every slice remembers its parent, and hands off with its register path + ID; the map is a graph, not a shredder.
- **Stop at the seam** — pre-spec only; hand off for depth.
