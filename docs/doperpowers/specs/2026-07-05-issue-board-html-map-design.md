# Issue Board — Interactive HTML Map — Design

**Goal:** Give the human reading the issue board an interactive, self-contained HTML graph (`MAP.html`) they can open in a browser — pan/zoom a layered DAG, click a node to see its full ticket detail, filter by state, and collapse epics — replacing the Mermaid `MAP.md` as the *primary* view. `MAP.md` survives, shrunk to a minimal node/state table so GitHub's web UI can still answer "what tickets exist" inline. The board's data model, scripts, and single-writer rules are untouched: this changes only what the human *sees*, not what the machine does.

## Problem

The board's only human view is `MAP.md` — a Mermaid `flowchart TD` regenerated on every board write by `board-map.sh --write` (`skills/issue-tracker/scripts/board-map.sh`). Mermaid renders inline on GitHub, which is its one real virtue, but as the board grows it stops being usable:

1. **No navigation.** Mermaid renders a fixed image. On a board of a few dozen tickets you cannot pan, zoom, or focus a subgraph — you scroll a wall.
2. **No detail on demand.** A node shows `id · title · state`. The ticket's note, PR link, blockers, lineage, and markdown path — all present in `map.json` — are invisible unless you go read `map.json` or run `board-show.sh` per ticket.
3. **No filtering.** "Show me only what's dispatchable" or "dim everything that's done" is impossible; every node competes for attention equally.
4. **Epics don't scale.** Mermaid wraps each epic in a `subgraph` box. Nested epics on a large board produce deep, cramped boxes with no way to collapse a finished epic out of view.

The data to do far better is already in `map.json` (`board-register.sh` writes the full node schema: `title, md, state, category, note, parent, blocked_by[], spawned_by, relates_to[], branch, pr, created, updated`). Only the *renderer* is the limit. An HTML file lifts every one of these ceilings — at the cost that GitHub will not render a raw `.html` inline, which is why the Mermaid view is kept as a shrunken fallback rather than deleted.

## Design Overview

The change is contained to one script plus one new template file. Every other board script (`board-register.sh`, `board-transition.sh`, `board-edge.sh`, `board-relate.sh`) calls `board-map.sh --write` as its final line and is **not touched** — the new behavior rides entirely inside `board-map.sh`.

- **`skills/issue-tracker/scripts/board-map.sh`** — reworked. `--write` now emits **two** files: `MAP.html` (primary, rich interactive graph, committed) and `MAP.md` (minimal fallback table). With no argument it prints the minimal table to stdout (terminal telemetry — the slot the current default occupied).
- **`skills/issue-tracker/scripts/board-map.template.html`** *(new)* — the self-contained HTML shell: all CSS and vanilla JS inline, plus a single sentinel token (`/*__BOARD_PAYLOAD__*/`) where the Python injects the data-and-layout JSON. Kept as a real `.html` file, not a bash heredoc, so the JS/CSS is editable with syntax highlighting and the Python stays small.

`MAP.html` and `MAP.md` are both pure render caches of `map.json` — regenerated on every board write, never hand-edited, both committed (a fresh clone opens the graph with no regeneration step).

### Zero-dependency, self-contained

Doperpowers is a zero-dependency plugin by design, and these files are committed into the *consumer* repo. So: no CDN references, no external stylesheets or fonts, no vendored graph library. The DAG layout is computed in Python (which already parses `map.json`); a few hundred lines of inline vanilla JS render the SVG and handle interaction. A single self-contained HTML file with everything inlined — openable offline by double-click.

## Layout — computed in Python, deterministic

`board-map.sh`'s Python reads `map.json` in numeric-id order (as the current Mermaid emission already does) and computes a **layered DAG**:

- **Layer assignment.** Longest-path layering over the `blocked_by` dependency graph: a node with no blockers sits at layer 0; every other node sits one layer below the deepest blocker it (transitively) waits on. Result: blockers are always drawn above their dependents — the natural top-to-bottom DAG reading. Hand-edited cycles in `map.json` cannot hang the walk (a visited-set clamps them), mirroring the cycle-tolerance the Mermaid emitter already has.
- **Ordering within a layer.** Stable by numeric id (deterministic). Epic members are kept adjacent within their layer so an epic's bounding box is contiguous. Crossing-minimization (barycenter passes) is explicitly deferred — noted in Revision Notes — because it trades determinism for aesthetics and the id-stable order is good enough at board sizes we expect.
- **Coordinates.** `y` from layer, `x` from position-within-layer, centered. Epics get a bounding rectangle around their (adjacent) children.
- **Determinism is a hard requirement.** No `Date.now()`, no randomness — anywhere. The layout is a pure function of `map.json`, so committed `MAP.html` diffs stay stable across writes that don't change the graph, and tests can assert structural facts rather than fighting nondeterministic output. (The `updated` timestamp shown in the header comes from the ticket data itself, already in `map.json`.)

The Python emits a payload object injected into the template:

```
{
  "meta":  { "updated": "<max ticket updated>", "count": <n> },
  "nodes": [ { "id","title","state","category","x","y","eligible",
               "note","pr","branch","parent","blocked_by","spawned_by",
               "relates_to","md","created","updated" }, ... ],
  "edges": [ { "from","to","kind" }, ... ],   // kind: block-active | block-done | spawned | relates
  "epics": [ { "id","title","state","x","y","w","h","children":[...] }, ... ]
}
```

## Interaction — inline vanilla JS

- **Render.** SVG. Nodes are rounded-rect cards showing `id · title` and a state line; **state color reuses the existing Mermaid palette verbatim** (`board-map.sh`'s `classDef` fills/strokes) so the two views stay visually consistent. ELIGIBLE (ready-for-agent + all blockers done + not an epic) gets the thick green border. Edges preserve today's Mermaid semantics 1:1: an **active** block is a solid arrow, a **satisfied** block (blocker already done) is dotted, `spawned` and `relates` are labeled dotted lines. Epics render as translucent labeled boxes behind their children.
- **Pan / zoom.** Mouse-wheel zoom and background-drag pan via the SVG `viewBox`.
- **Node click → detail panel.** A side panel shows the full node: id, title, category, state, note, `blocked_by`, `spawned_by`, `relates_to`, branch, PR (as a link), and the ticket markdown path.
- **State filter / highlight.** Top-bar chips toggle states (dim/undim) and offer an "ELIGIBLE only" highlight.
- **Collapse / expand epics.** Clicking an epic's header collapses it to a single node: its children and their internal edges hide, and edges that crossed the epic boundary re-route to the collapsed epic node. Clicking again expands. This is the primary interactive win for large boards — and the main JS-complexity item.
- **Legend.** Same color/edge vocabulary as the Mermaid legend, rendered in-page.

## MD fallback — "what exists", for GitHub

`MAP.md` shrinks to a graphless minimal table, readable inline on GitHub:

```
# Issue Board

_Board updated <date> · <N> tickets · full interactive graph in MAP.html (open in a browser)_

| ticket | state | title | PR |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | ELIGIBLE | … | … |
```

Rows are in numeric-id order. A `ready-for-agent` node that is eligible shows `ELIGIBLE` in the state column (the same label rule the Mermaid view uses today). The PR column links when a `pr` is set.

## Testing

The board toolkit's hermetic bash suite (`tests/issue-tracker/test-board-scripts.sh`) currently asserts Mermaid content in `MAP.md` (e.g. `T20 ==> T21` for an active block, `-. relates .-` for a relates edge, epic subgraph lines). Because those visuals move to `MAP.html`, those assertions are **repointed**:

- **`MAP.html` structural assertions** (grep the emitted file): the payload sentinel is gone (data injected), each expected node id is present with its state class, edges of each `kind` are present (a `block-active`/`block-done` pair, a `spawned`, a `relates`), epic entries render, and the `eligible` flag is set on the right node. Assert *structure*, not pixel coordinates — deterministic layout makes this reliable without being brittle.
- **`MAP.md` fallback assertions**: the new table has a row per ticket, the header count is right, `ELIGIBLE` appears for the eligible node, and a PR cell links when set.
- **Auto-refresh coverage stays**: every write script still triggers a `MAP.html` + `MAP.md` refresh; the existing "MAP.md auto-refreshed on write" checks become "both files refreshed on write".

New tests append after the existing sections so the suite's exact log-line and row-count assertions at earlier fixed points stay valid (the same append-only discipline the current suite requires).

## Acceptance (observable behavior)

From a throwaway consumer repo with a registered board:

1. `board-map.sh --write` writes both `doperpowers/issue-tracker/MAP.html` and `.../MAP.md`; stdout is the minimal table.
2. `MAP.html` is a single self-contained file: `grep -Eic 'src="https?://|href="https?://[^"]*\.css|cdn' MAP.html` returns 0 (no external references).
3. Opening `MAP.html` in a browser shows the layered DAG; blockers sit above dependents; wheel-zoom and drag-pan work; clicking a node opens a panel with that ticket's note/PR/blockers/md-path; a state filter dims non-matching nodes; clicking an epic header collapses and re-expands it.
4. `MAP.md` renders on GitHub as a table with one row per ticket and `ELIGIBLE` on the dispatchable node.
5. Every board-mutating script (`board-register/transition/edge/relate`) leaves both files freshly regenerated.
6. `tests/issue-tracker/test-board-scripts.sh` passes with the repointed assertions.
7. `scripts/lint-shell.sh` passes on `board-map.sh`.

## Decision Log

- Decision: `MAP.html` becomes the **primary** view; `MAP.md` is kept but shrunk to a graphless node/state table.
  Rationale: The human reads the board locally where a rich interactive graph wins decisively; but a raw `.html` does not render inline on GitHub, so deleting the Mermaid view would lose the "glance at what exists on GitHub" affordance. Shrinking rather than deleting keeps both surfaces without maintaining two full graph renderers. Rejected: **replace `MAP.md` entirely** (loses GitHub inline view). Rejected: **coexist as two full views** (Mermaid graph + HTML graph both maintained — double the render surface and diff noise for a view nobody reads once the HTML exists).
  Date: 2026-07-05 (human partner chose "HTML primary, MD shrinks to fallback")

- Decision: The HTML is **interactive** (pan/zoom, click-to-detail, state filter, collapsible epics), not a static image.
  Rationale: Mermaid already produces a static graph; a static SVG would be a marginal gain over what exists. The interaction *is* the reason to move to HTML. Rejected: **static positioned SVG with hover tooltips** (barely better than Mermaid; a big board can't be navigated). Rejected: **middle — static layout with pan/zoom only, no filter/detail** (leaves the highest-value affordances, detail-on-demand and epic collapse, on the table).
  Date: 2026-07-05 (human partner chose "interactive")

- Decision: Self-contained single HTML, **layout computed in Python + inline vanilla JS**; no vendored graph library.
  Rationale: Zero-dependency is a hard project rule and the file is committed into every consumer repo — vendoring a ~1 MB library (cytoscape/vis) into a committed, per-write-regenerated file is against the repo ethos and bloats consumer repos. Python already parses `map.json`, so it owns the deterministic layout (as it already owns Mermaid emission); JS owns only rendering and interaction. Rejected: **vendor a graph library inlined** (megabyte blob committed per consumer repo; non-deterministic library layout breaks stable diffs and tests).
  Date: 2026-07-05

- Decision: Epics are **collapsible** (click header to collapse to a single node / expand).
  Rationale: The board's "for humans" pain is worst on large boards with nested epics; collapse is the single most valuable large-board affordance. Rejected: **static translucent bounding box** (1:1 with today's Mermaid subgraph, simpler — but on a board of dozens of nodes the boxes crowd and there's no way to fold a finished epic out of view).
  Date: 2026-07-05 (human partner chose "collapsible")

- Decision: `MAP.html` is **committed** to the consumer repo (like `MAP.md`).
  Rationale: A fresh clone opens the graph immediately with no regeneration step, and board state lives in git history. Deterministic layout keeps the committed diffs stable. Rejected: **gitignore `MAP.html`** (requires a manual `board-map.sh --write` after clone before the graph exists; the fallback `MAP.md` alone would be the only committed human view).
  Date: 2026-07-05 (human partner chose "commit")

- Decision: The HTML shell lives in a separate `board-map.template.html`, not a bash/Python heredoc.
  Rationale: A few hundred lines of CSS+JS in a heredoc is unmaintainable (no syntax highlighting, quoting hazards, and it bloats the script). A real `.html` template with one injection sentinel keeps the JS editable and the Python small. Trade-off: `board-map.sh` now depends on a sibling file existing — acceptable, it ships in the same `scripts/` directory.
  Date: 2026-07-05

- Decision: State colors and edge semantics are carried over **verbatim** from the current Mermaid renderer.
  Rationale: The two views coexist; visual consistency (same green=done, blue=in-progress, thick-green-border=ELIGIBLE, solid=active-block, dotted=satisfied) means a reader's learned vocabulary transfers between them for free.
  Date: 2026-07-05

- Decision: Layout is **deterministic** (no `Date.now`/randomness); crossing-minimization deferred.
  Rationale: A committed, per-write-regenerated file must diff cleanly, and tests must be able to assert output; both require determinism. Barycenter crossing-reduction is an aesthetic improvement that would introduce ordering instability — deferred to a later revision if board sizes make crossings a real problem.
  Date: 2026-07-05

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: No live board exists in the doperpowers repo itself — `doperpowers/issue-tracker/` is lazily created in the *consumer* repo on first `board-register.sh`.
  Evidence: `ls doperpowers/issue-tracker/` returns nothing in this repo; `_board_init` (`_lib.sh`) creates the dir/map on first register. Implication: the work is pure toolkit change, validated through the hermetic test harness, not against a real board.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

Pending — written at finish.

## Revision Notes

- 2026-07-05: Initial version — terminal artifact of the brainstorm (move the board's human view from Mermaid `MAP.md` to an interactive self-contained `MAP.html`, Mermaid kept as a shrunken fallback). Four design forks decided with the human partner: HTML-primary/MD-fallback, interactive, collapsible epics, committed `MAP.html`.
