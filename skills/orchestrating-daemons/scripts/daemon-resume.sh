#
# Continue a daemon by FORKING a new native background turn. A daemon's identity
# is its ORIGINAL session uuid (the registry meta filename); each resume runs
# `claude stop` on the current turn to release its bg ownership (which also drops
# it from the active `claude agents` view), then `claude --bg --resume <current>`
# to fork a fresh bg agent that carries the full conversation forward. The new
# turn gets its own short/uuid; the registry chains them via the `current` field,
# so the daemon keeps one stable id while its human-visible short changes.
#
# Because the forked turn is a native `--bg` agent, it is visible in
# `claude agents` (kind=background) and survives this orchestrator ending — the
# toolkit never kills it.
#
# NEVER RUN THIS IN THE FOREGROUND — it blocks while the watcher polls for the
# forked turn to finish, prints the reply, then exits. Run it under a Monitor (the
# reply streams into context as an event — no read step) or a background shell
# (Bash run_in_background: true). Resume is scoped to the daemon's cwd, which this
# script restores.
